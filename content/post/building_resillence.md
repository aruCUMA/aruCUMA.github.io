		- action oriented unemotionally and don't judge: Discuss —— Plan —— Action
		- What aspects of the situation can you improve in the future?
		- What can you do to be sure this doesn't happen again?
		- Is there anything positive that came out of the situation?
		- Can you have any positive influence on what happens next?
		(中国人的又一特点：把错误或失败看得特别重，所有的反思其实不是 improvement，是羞辱和认罪)
	- Recovery Steps ^2b745d
		- Take a break: think about something else
		- Redirect
		- Reconnect with a fresher perspective, review and prioritize
	- Taking cathartic action: Let it go
		- When you have no attachment to the situation, like it's not your job
		- When it will not negatively affect you
		- When you have done everything possible and the situation is not improving, like disconnect with a relationship that costs too much energy
		- When the stress is too high and extra work on it is unworthy
