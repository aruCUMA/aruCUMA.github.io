[By analyzing your Stress x Coping Skills](https://wormhole.app/BDA9L#jAM9NjApQG3u0W-4N_ajRw)

### Ask and Face Rejection
Practice ask to get used to hearing no, and never apologize for asking, but praise yourself for stretching your asking muscles and look for next chance to ask.

Ask for different things
- Not sure you'll receive
- Less likely to receive
- More challenging but realistic

watch your internal language
- keep your internal dialogue positive
- manage/hone in on your verbalized response: I thought I'd ask anyway./Thanks for letting me know. It doesn't hurt to ask.

Be aware of your daily energy flow:
- When are you at your best? Morning, midday or late afternoon.
- When do you prefer to tackle projects?
- When are you most productive?
- Does it take you a while to get in the groove at work?

Stay energized and restore appropriately to face surprising difficulties

## How to face rejections and difficulties
### Positive Thinking
#### think short term 
Acknowledge the negative events are **temporary**, **changeable** and **associated only with the situation**

Keep the perspective tight and focus on here and now

#### think local
Focus only on yourself and what you can do to change the situation

Don't compare to others and their circumstances as their situations may not be as tough as yours

#### Keep things in perspective
What the worst-case of this setback could be

Find the silver lining

#### Talk positively
| negative word | positive word |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| Failure       | Obstacle      |
| Downfall      | Setback       |
| Horrible      | Challenging   |

#### Evaluate your action
- Reflect on what could have done differently.
- Reflect on how did I handled this situation.
- Reflect on your attitude: Did I stay positive?

#### Choose to be positive
3:1 = positive : negative is good for health mentally and physically.
| Attitude                                                                                             | React to bad review       |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| 很多人骂我，我很烂，我不适合这个工作                                                                 | negative                  |
| 很多人骂我，他们是一群嫉妒心强的王八蛋, 我要证明他们是错的                                           | positive but unrealistic  |
| 我得到了很多能够让我提高的建议，我发现了能进步的方向。事情有点棘手，但长远看我会成长很多，比之前好。 | positive and constructive |

### Recruit and Connect with your advisor board
Action oriented unemotionally and don't judge: Discuss —— Plan —— Action

- What aspects of the situation can you improve in the future?
- What can you do to be sure this doesn't happen again?
- Is there anything positive that came out of the situation?
- Can you have any positive influence on what happens next?

### Recovery Steps
Take a break: think about something else

Redirect

Reconnect with a fresher perspective, review and prioritize

Taking cathartic action: Let it go
- When you have no attachment to the situation, like it's not your job
- When it will not negatively affect you
- When you have done everything possible and the situation is not improving, like disconnect with a relationship that costs too much energy
- When the stress is too high and extra work on it is unworthy
